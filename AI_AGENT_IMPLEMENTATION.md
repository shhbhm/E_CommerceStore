## How the AI Agent Works

### 1. Product Knowledge Base Creation

**Embedding Generation Process:**
```javascript
// Each product gets converted to a vector representation
const textToEmbed = `${product.title} ${product.description} ${product.category} ${product.brand}`;
const embedding = await cohereAPI.generateEmbedding(textToEmbed);

// Stored in MongoDB with metadata
await ProductEmbedding.create({
    productId: product._id,
    embedding: embedding, // Array of 1024 numbers
    metadata: {
        title: product.title,
        description: product.description,
        category: product.category,
        brand: product.brand,
        price: product.price,
        averageReview: product.averageReview
    }
});
```

**What happens:** Every product in the catalog is converted into a numerical vector (array of 1024 numbers) that captures its semantic meaning. This creates a searchable knowledge base where similar products cluster together in vector space.

### 2. User Query Processing

**Intelligent Query Understanding:**
```javascript
// User asks: "Show me winter jackets under $100"
const queryEmbedding = await generateEmbedding(userMessage);
const similarProducts = await findSimilarProducts(queryEmbedding, limit: 5);

// AI finds products matching semantic intent, not just keywords
```

**Semantic Search Process:**
1. **Query Vectorization**: User's natural language query is converted to vector using Cohere's embed-english-v3.0
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity computed against all stored product vectors
3. **Ranking**: Products ranked by semantic relevance to query (similarity score 0-1)
4. **Context Assembly**: Top 5 matching products gathered with full metadata

### 3. Contextual Response Generation

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation:**
```javascript
const prompt = `You are a helpful e-commerce assistant. Use the following information to help answer the customer's question:

Store Information:
- Total number of products: ${totalProducts}

Relevant Products:
${context}

Customer Question: ${message}

Please provide a helpful response that incorporates relevant product information when appropriate.`;
```

**Response Generation:**
- **Context Injection**: Relevant product data is injected into the prompt
- **LLM Processing**: Cohere's command model generates human-like responses
- **Product Integration**: AI naturally incorporates product recommendations
- **Conversational Flow**: Maintains natural dialogue while being informative

## AI Agent Capabilities

### 1. Product Recommendation Engine

**Natural Language Product Discovery:**
```
User: "I need running shoes for marathon training"
AI Process: 
  - Understands intent (athletic footwear, high performance)
  - Searches vector space for running shoes
  - Considers brand reputation, price range, reviews
AI Response: "For marathon training, I recommend the Nike Air Max or Adidas Ultraboost. The Nike Air Max offers excellent cushioning at $109.99 with a 4.8/5 rating, while the Adidas Ultraboost provides premium Boost technology at $149.99..."
```

**Category-Based Assistance:**
```
User: "What's good for winter weather?"
AI Process:
  - Identifies seasonal context
  - Searches for winter-appropriate categories
  - Considers warmth, durability, style factors
AI Response: "For winter weather, I suggest checking out our winter collection. The Zara Winter Coat at $99.99 offers excellent warmth and style, while Nike Winter Boots provide waterproof protection..."
```

### 2. Intelligent Customer Support

**Product Information Queries:**
```javascript
// User: "Tell me about the Nike Air Max features"
// AI Process:
// 1. Vector search finds Nike Air Max products
// 2. Extracts product specifications and descriptions  
// 3. Generates comprehensive feature explanation
// Response: "The Nike Air Max features visible Air cushioning technology in the heel for impact protection, breathable mesh upper for ventilation, and rubber outsole for durability. Currently priced at $109.99 with 4.8/5 customer rating..."
```

**Store Information:**
- **Inventory Queries**: "How many products do you have?" → "We currently have 945 products across 5 categories"
- **Category Breakdown**: "What categories do you sell?" → Lists Men, Women, Kids, Accessories, Footwear
- **Brand Information**: "What brands do you carry?" → Nike, Adidas, Zara, Puma, Levi's

### 3. Shopping Assistance

**Price-Based Filtering:**
```
User: "Show me Nike shoes under $50"
AI Process:
  - Filters by brand (Nike)
  - Filters by category (shoes)
  - Applies price constraint (<$50)
  - Ranks by relevance and reviews
```

**Comparison Shopping:**
```
User: "Compare Nike vs Adidas running shoes"
AI Process:
  - Identifies both brands' running shoes
  - Analyzes features, prices, reviews
  - Provides structured comparison
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Vector Similarity Search Algorithm

```javascript
// EmbeddingService.js
cosineSimilarity(vecA, vecB) {
    const dotProduct = vecA.reduce((sum, a, i) => sum + a * vecB[i], 0);
    const magnitudeA = Math.sqrt(vecA.reduce((sum, a) => sum + a * a, 0));
    const magnitudeB = Math.sqrt(vecB.reduce((sum, b) => sum + b * b, 0));
    return dotProduct / (magnitudeA * magnitudeB);
}

async findSimilarProducts(query, limit = 5) {
    const queryEmbedding = await this.generateEmbedding(query);
    const allEmbeddings = await ProductEmbedding.find({});
    
    const similarities = allEmbeddings.map(product => ({
        productId: product.productId,
        metadata: product.metadata,
        similarity: this.cosineSimilarity(queryEmbedding, product.embedding)
    }));
    
    return similarities
        .sort((a, b) => b.similarity - a.similarity)
        .slice(0, limit);
}
```

**Why Cosine Similarity:**
- **Magnitude Independent**: Focuses on direction, not scale
- **High-Dimensional Effectiveness**: Works well with 1024-dimensional vectors  
- **Semantic Relevance**: Captures conceptual similarity better than keyword matching

### Real-Time Chat Interface

```javascript
// ChatWidget.jsx - Real-time messaging component
const ChatWidget = () => {
    const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
    const [inputMessage, setInputMessage] = useState('');
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

    const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        if (!inputMessage.trim()) return;

        const userMessage = inputMessage;
        setInputMessage('');
        setMessages(prev => [...prev, { text: userMessage, sender: 'user' }]);
        setIsLoading(true);

        try {
            const response = await sendMessage(userMessage);
            if (response.success) {
                setMessages(prev => [...prev, { 
                    text: response.response, 
                    sender: 'bot' 
                }]);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            setMessages(prev => [...prev, {
                text: 'Sorry, I encountered an error. Please try again.',
                sender: 'bot',
                isError: true
            }]);
        } finally {
            setIsLoading(false);
        }
    };
```

    token: process.env.COHERE_API_KEY, // Never expose in client code
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'production' : 'sandbox'
});

// Input sanitization
const sanitizeUserInput = (message) => {
    return message
        .replace(/<script\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\/script>/gi, '')
        .trim()
        .substring(0, 500); // Limit length
};
```

- No storage of personal conversation data
- API calls don't include user identification
- Product queries are anonymized
- GDPR-compliant data handling

### 2. Performance Optimization

**Caching Strategies:**
```javascript
// Cache frequently accessed embeddings
const embeddings = new Map();

const getCachedEmbedding = async (text) => {
    if (embeddings.has(text)) {
        return embeddings.get(text);
    }
    
    const embedding = await generateEmbedding(text);
    embeddings.set(text, embedding);
    return embedding;
};
```

**Batch Processing:**
- Update embeddings in batches during off-peak hours
- Pre-compute common query responses
- Implement response caching for popular queries

### 3. Monitoring & Analytics

**Performance Tracking:**
```javascript
// Response time monitoring
const chatMetrics = {
    averageResponseTime: 0,
    totalRequests: 0,
    errorRate: 0,
    userSatisfaction: 0
};

const trackChatPerformance = (startTime, success) => {
    const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    chatMetrics.averageResponseTime = 
        (chatMetrics.averageResponseTime * chatMetrics.totalRequests + responseTime) / 
        (chatMetrics.totalRequests + 1);
    chatMetrics.totalRequests++;
    if (!success) chatMetrics.errorRate++;
