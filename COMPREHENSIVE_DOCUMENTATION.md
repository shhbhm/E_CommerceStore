---

## 8. Authentication & Authorization

### Method Used: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

### Authentication Flow
1. **Registration/Login**: User provides credentials
2. **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with 12 salt rounds
3. **Token Generation**: JWT signed with secret key
4. **Token Storage**: HTTP-only cookie for security
5. **Request Validation**: Middleware checks token on protected routes

### Implementation Details

**JWT Configuration**:
```javascript
// Token generation
const token = jwt.sign(
  { id: user._id, role: user.role, email: user.email },
  process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '60m' }
);

// Cookie setting
res.cookie('token', token, { 
  httpOnly: true, 
  secure: false, // true in production
  maxAge: 3600000 // 1 hour
});
```

**Authentication Middleware**:
```javascript
const authMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.cookies.token;
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
  }
};
```

### Protected Routes Implementation
- **Client-side**: `CheckAuth` component wraps protected routes
- **Server-side**: `authMiddleware` validates requests
- **Role-based Access**: Admin routes check for admin role

### Password Reset Flow (Prepared)
1. User requests password reset
2. Generate secure reset token
3. Send email with reset link
4. Validate token and allow password update

---

## 10. State Management

### Approach: Redux Toolkit

### Store Configuration
```javascript
// client/src/store/store.js
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    auth: authReducer,
    adminProducts: adminProductsSlice,
    adminOrder: adminOrderSlice,
    shopProducts: shopProductsSlice,
    shopCart: shopCartSlice,
    shopAddress: shopAddressSlice,
    shopOrder: shopOrderSlice,
    shopSearch: shopSearchSlice,
    shopReview: shopReviewSlice,
    commonFeature: commonFeatureSlice,
  },
});
```

### State Slices Breakdown

**Authentication Slice** (`auth-slice/index.js`):
- User login/logout state
- Authentication status
- User role and permissions
- Token management

**Admin Product Slice** (`admin/products-slice.js`):
- Product CRUD operations
- Image upload status
- Product list management
- Form state for product creation/editing

**Shop Cart Slice** (`shop/cart-slice.js`):
- Cart items management
- Quantity updates
- Total calculations
- Cart persistence

**Shop Order Slice** (`shop/order-slice.js`):
- Order creation process
- Order history
- Order status tracking
- Payment information

### Data Flow Patterns

**Async Actions with createAsyncThunk**:
```javascript
export const fetchAllProducts = createAsyncThunk(
  'adminProducts/fetchAllProducts',
  async () => {
    const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/admin/products/get`);
    return response.data;
  }
);
```

**Component State Usage**:
```javascript
const { productList, isLoading } = useSelector(state => state.adminProducts);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

useEffect(() => {
  dispatch(fetchAllProducts());
}, [dispatch]);
```

### Why Redux Toolkit Was Chosen
1. **Complex State Logic**: Multiple user types with different data needs
2. **Cross-Component Communication**: Cart updates affecting multiple components
3. **Predictable State Updates**: Clear action-based state changes
4. **DevTools Integration**: Excellent debugging capabilities
5. **Async Operation Handling**: Built-in support for API calls
